SOFTWARE INSTALLATION

Install the nodejs javascript runtime environment:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

once installed, edit the path variable (in windows):
add ;C:\Program Files\nodejs\
To the end of your Path variable 
on the "User variable" section 
of the Environment Variables 
on the System Properties.
If you never did this before read this:
https://www.h3xed.com/windows/how-to-add-to-and-edit-windows-path-variable

Install the Truffle IDE globally from the windows terminal:
npm uninstall -g truffle
npm install -g truffle@v5.11.5  (use this version to run the tests)
Mac: check out https://www.mobilefish.com/developer/blockchain/blockchain_quickguide_truffle.html

Install liteserver globally from the windows terminal:
npm install -g lite-server
or goto: https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server

When you finish the installation open the cmd prompt (terminal) and type:

truffle version

you should see:
Truffle v5.11.5 (core: 5.11.5)
Solidity - ^0.5.0 (solc-js)
Node v20.15.0
Web3.js v1.10.0

if the versions are too high it is easiest to just install node with the correct versions.

Install Ganache:
http://truffleframework.com/ganache and click the download button
you should see Ganache started at http://127.0.0.1:7545
run Ganache, quitstart mode
Open Ganache:
In Ganache Accounts tab you should see 10 addresses each with 100 tesntet ether you have access to.

run Ganache (w/workspace):
run Ganache, workspace mode
Workspace name: Petshop
ADD PROJECT: navigate and select truffle-config.js
save workspace
The workspace has the advantage of providing contract information in Ganache
under the tab called CONTRACTS
it shows the contracts, the state variables, the calls and the transactions

Intall Metamask in your **default** browser:
https://metamask.io/download.html

Configure Metamask with Ganache:
select: "No, I already have a seed phrase", import wallet
copy the MNEMONIC from Ganache and paste it into
"Enter your secret twelve word phrase here to restore your vault.
Wallet Seed:"
provide a password
import
GOTO: Main Ethereum Network Dropdown List (top right), 
and add a new network
New RPC URL field:
copy RPC server address from Ganache (should be HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545) and paste it to New RPC URL
Chain ID field:
write Ganache's Chain ID: 1337 = 0x539 in hex

Message:
The message "This Chain ID is currently used by the Localhost 8545 network" can be disregarded
Ganache is at HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545 and this setup still works without any further changes. 
Ganache-cli is at HTTP://127.0.0.1:8545, and this setup works equally well. 
So both Ganache and Ganache-cli work without modification. 

Currency Symbol field:
ETH 
click save

Close the Custom RPC setup window by clicking X
You should see Account 1 with 100 Ether. This address should be the same as:
In Ganache accounts tab, right under MNEMONIC, the first (topmost) account.
By the way, this is the Coinbase account of your node.
